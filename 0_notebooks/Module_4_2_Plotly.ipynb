The code is open-source, but they want you to pay to use their dashboard, which company C-level dudes seem to like (whether or not those dashboards get used at all by employees is a whole other matter...). Anyways, other options for interactive plotting include `bokeh` and 'pygal', among others, but I like plotly best.\n","\n","For questions on this notebook, ask them on the [GEOL 557 slack](https://join.slack.com/t/minesgeo/shared_invite/zt-cqawm4lu-Zcfpf4mBLwjnksY6_umlKA)<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/minesgeo/shared_invite/zt-cqawm4lu-Zcfpf4mBLwjnksY6_umlKA\">\n","<img src=\"https://cdn.brandfolder.io/5H442O3W/as/pl546j-7le8zk-ex8w65/Slack_RGB.svg\" alt=\"Go to the GEOl 557 slack\" width=\"100\">\n","</a>\n","\n","## Instructions\n","Work through this notebook - there will be several places where you need to fill-in-the-blank or write some code into an open cell.
