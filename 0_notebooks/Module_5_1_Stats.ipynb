When I say descriptive statistics, I mean things like distribution shapes, quantiles, mean, and median - sometimes these are also called parameters. So then, what are comparative statistics? Exactly what they sound like, a stat that compares two distributions - we will focus on familiar things like the student's t-test (a parametric test, which assumes a normal distribution that is parameterized by a mean and standard deviation) and also some much more useful non-parametric methods that don't assume a distribution shape - the KS test is a great example of a non-parametric method that is useful for geoscience data that is often not normally distributed. Don't be too scared of the jargon here, it is relatively easy to understand and use. \n","\n","For questions on this notebook, ask them on the [GEOL 557 slack](https://join.slack.com/t/minesgeo/shared_invite/zt-cqawm4lu-Zcfpf4mBLwjnksY6_umlKA)<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/minesgeo/shared_invite/zt-cqawm4lu-Zcfpf4mBLwjnksY6_umlKA\">\n","<img src=\"https://cdn.brandfolder.io/5H442O3W/as/pl546j-7le8zk-ex8w65/Slack_RGB.svg\" alt=\"Go to the GEOl 557 slack\" width=\"100\">\n","</a>\n","\n","## Instructions\n","Work through this notebook - there will be several places where you need to fill-in-the-blank or write some code into an open cell.
