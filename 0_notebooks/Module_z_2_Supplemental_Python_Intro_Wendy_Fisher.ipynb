Since we won't study functions and lambdas until after this is assigned, you do not need to create functions (or lambdas) to solve any of these - just a few lines of code using the variable provided in the input cell (be sure to execute the input cell before trying your code!)\n","\n","Unless specified, you are free to solve the problems in any way you are comfortable, including using Python libraries you are familiar with (but all of these are solvable just using Python's built-in features, plus maybe the `math` library).  The more concise your problem, the better (in general) and easier for us to grade!\n","\n","### Grading\n","\n","For grading purposes, we will clear all outputs from all your cells and then run them all from the top.  Please test your notebook in the same fashion before turning it in.\n","\n","### Submitting Your Solution\n","\n","To submit your notebook, first clear all the cells (this won't matter too much this time, but for larger data sets in the future, it will make the file smaller).  Then use the File->Download As->Notebook to obtain the notebook file.  Finally, submit the notebook file on Canvas.\n","\n","### Hints\n","\n","- The sample inputs we give you below may be hard to work with.  Open up new cells in this or another notebook and test simpler inputs, if needed, to make debugging easier.\n","- Often times Python provides a built-in function or library to make tasks easier.  Spend some time in the Python docs (or Google) searching for what you need.\n","- While comprehensions, slices, and other Python \"goodies\" often provide the most elegant solution, it is often easier (when used to other languages) to start with a `for` loop solution, and then migrate that solution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UeYtOCI27WqN"},"source":["---\n","\n","#### Problem 1: Basic Statistics (20 points)\n","\n","Given the list `numbers` containing (surprise!) numbers, calculate the following statistics on the list: maximum, minimum, sample mean (average), and the standard deviation (use the *corrected sample standard deviation*, i.e., the square root of the unbiased sample variance.
